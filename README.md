# Assignment about Loops

1. Write a for loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.
2. Write a for loop that prints the numbers 10 through 1.
3. Explain the code below. Write a comments to each line.
    ```js
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    console.log(sum);
    ```
4. How many iterations are in the loop below? Explain.
    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    ```
5. What does the break statement do? Explain and give an example.
6. What does the continue statement do? Explain and give an example.
7. Generate and print a random number between 1 adn 100 until you get the number 27;
8. Generate Random Password. HINT - Use ASCII codes to generate random characters.
9. "There is a man somewhere, Find him", Below code generates string with 2 possible characters, `" "` and `"?"`. Write a code that will find the position of `"?"`.
    ```js
    let str = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        str += Math.random() > 0.5 ? " " : "?";
    }
    console.log(str);

    // write code that finds the position (index) of "?".
    // do not use indexOf method!
    // HINT: You can iterate strings' characters using for loop.
    // and you can access each character by using str[i]
    ``` 
10. "Mystery Room", Write a code that will generate 2d representation of a room. you should generate an empty space, wall or a mystery box. You can use any characters you want. The room should be 10x10. The room should have 10 walls, 1 mystery boxes and the rest should be empty space, mystey box location should be random!. The room should look something like this:
    ```
